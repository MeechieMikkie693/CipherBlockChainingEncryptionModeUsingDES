Hey there!!! This is CipherBlockChainingEncryptionMode using DES algorithm in a client server architecture form of text communication.
You can send text messages of 512 bits, 1kb, 10 kb etc...(of any size, lol) between client and server (but only once, you can modify the code to have a prolonged communication and maybe even send me a pull request with the updated code version!!!.)
Currently, the text can be sent as only one line long paragraph. Multiple paragraphs of text exchange is not yet implemented. (Improvements regarding this too, is highly appreciated). 
You can also refer the pdf file uploaded 
Thank you and happy coding!!!!
